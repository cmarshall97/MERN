***Make sure in src folder that we add another folder titled ' components' and in the src/app.js we add import React from 'react';
AND delete all thats between divs in app.js
IMPORTANT: When we create a project via create-react-app, we are installing React. Within our React files, 
when we write import React from 'react', we can write in JSX within that file without needing to add any extra dependencies.

JSX (JavaScript XML) is an extension to JavaScript that allows us to write code that closely resembles HTML without 
having to make it a string. This is the preferred way to use React.
