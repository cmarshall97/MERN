EXPRESS = framework for creating servers

Postman = tool used to enable us to make requests and save them
-can be used as a browserless client in the way we are using it. Can be used to test API without building frontend

Backend...
1) Server.js
2) Npm init  (gives us package.json wherewe can see what our dependencies are)
3) Npm install express

configure your server:

const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const PORT = 8000

app.listen() - function that binds and listens for connections on the specified host and port

4)nodemon server.js

//app/.get/post/put/delete (HTTP verb functions)
///app.listen(runs the serve)
//app.use means any request sent through this server will go through the middleware functions first - the below on lines 25-26

app.use(express.json()); //allows us to parse JSON objects coming in from POSTS and PUT requests
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: true})); //allows us to parse strings and arrays comig in with JSON object


LESSON 3

when we type in a url we are sending in a request for an object. which returns a key value pair

GET is requesting data {KEY:VALUE}
POST is the client sending data via form for it to do something without (FORM DATA)


POST EXAMPLE:
site.com -> puts the form data in to an {Object} -> hits the middleware function s that out the object in to a body that then hits our route -> 
-> converts to json and responds back to the client
